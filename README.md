Carrots
==================================================

Carrots is a simple PHP image gallery script, perfect to easily build a portfolio site.
You just have to upload it to your server along with your image files and that's it.
No code. No databases. Just you and your FTP client.

Carrots uses the [slimbox2 project](http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2) and [HTML5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) to enable HTML5 compatibility in IE.


Requirements
--------------------------------------

* PHP 5 or higher.
* FTP access.


How to install
--------------------------------------

1. Download Carrots and unzip it on your computer.
2. Open the settings.php file in a plain text editor (like notepad) and customize it.
3. Upload the contents to your site.
4. Upload your folders with images to the 'images' folder.


What can I customize?
--------------------------------------

**Your site name**
Change the value of *$settings['title']*.

**Your image folders path**
Set the new one in *$settings['path']*.

**Your theme**
Make a new CSS file in the styles folder. Set the name of the file you choose in *$settings['theme']*.

**The order of the menu**
Go to *$settings['order_menu']* and set it to *'ASC'* for alphabetical order or *'DESC'* for descending alphabetical order.

**The size of the thumbnails**
Set the new one on *$settings['width']* and *$settings['height']*.

**I don't want to display the menu**
Set *$settings['show_menu']* to *false* to hide it.

**I don't like the grid in the home page**
Set *$settings['show_covers_grid']* to *false* to hide it.

**I want to set a default cover image for a gallery**
Just change the image name to *_cover*.

**I want to show a gallery description**
Make a new textfile with the description in the proper folder and name it *_info.txt*.

**I want to choose the order of the files**
