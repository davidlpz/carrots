Carrots
==================================================

Carrots is a simple PHP image gallery script, perfect to easily build a portfolio site.
You just have to upload it to your server along with your image files and that's it.
No code. No databases. Just you and your FTP client.

Carrots uses the [slimbox2 project](http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2) and [HTML5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) to enable HTML5 compatibility in IE.


Requirements
--------------------------------------

* PHP 5 or higher.
* FTP access.


How to install
--------------------------------------

1. Download Carrots and unzip it on your computer.
2. Open the settings.php file in a plain text editor (like notepad) and customize it.
3. Upload the contents to your site.
4. Upload your folders with images to the 'images' folder.
